BB-bots is a WIP offline big brother simulator similar to https://www.brantsteele.com/bigbrother/ . 

The motivation for this project is that brantsteele is an old website with a difficult UI to use. 
It is painful to set up custom games.
It is difficult to see the relationships the characters have with each other and how they develop throughout the game.
Some of the logic doesn't seem to make sense when the characters make their descisions.

BB-bots seeks to fix these issues by having setup be as simple as dragging and dropping images or copy-pasting links (with optional names), making a UI that is focused on delivering information in an easy to read way, and revamping the logic used for players to make game descisions.
